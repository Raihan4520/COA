## Introduction

This repository includes pictures of lab codes and practice codes written during the COA course at AIUB. The course focused on fundamental concepts of computer organization, including assembly language programming, CPU architecture, and memory management. The labs and assignments provided hands-on experience using the emu8086 emulator.

## Course Overview

The **Computer Organization and Architecture (COA)** course provides an in-depth understanding of how computers function at the hardware level and how software interacts with hardware. It covers both theoretical and practical aspects of computer systems, including assembly language programming and system-level concepts. The course is designed to give students a comprehensive view of the internal mechanisms of computers, focusing on both organization (how hardware components are structured) and architecture (how they function together to execute instructions).

### Key Topics:

1. **Fundamental Concepts of Computer Organization**:
   - Understand the internal components of a computer and their organization.
   - Study instruction types, formats, and how instructions are executed at the hardware level.

2. **Assembly Language Programming**:
   - Learn how to assemble and execute programs written in assembly language.
   - Explore program structure, input/output instructions, subroutines, and macros.
   - Understand flag registers, interrupts, and system services.
   - Practice translating high-level language code into assembly language.

3. **Computer Architecture**:
   - Delve into the architecture of computers, focusing on how different components interact to process data.
   - Explore registers, cache memory, numeric and string processing, and concurrent processes.
   - Study computer BUS standards and addressing methods, and learn about the formation of high-level control structures.

4. **Input/Output Systems and File Handling**:
   - Study disk geometry and file systems, including how file I/O is handled at a low level.
   - Understand the underlying structure of modern file systems and how operating systems manage files.

5. **Embedded Systems and Application Development**:
   - Learn to develop basic applications using hardware platforms like **Raspberry Pi** and **Arduino**.
   - Understand the role of embedded systems in modern computing and how they can be programmed to interface with physical devices.

## Repository Structure

- ðŸ“‚**Final/Lab Code Pictures**: Contains pictures of lab code from final term.
- ðŸ“‚**Mid/Lab Code Pictures**: Contains pictures of lab code from mid term.
- ðŸ“‚**Practice Codes**: Contains practice codes performed throughout the course.

These codes helps strengthen the understanding of computer architecture and assembly language.

## emu8086

The lab work for this course was done using the **emu8086** emulator, which allows for the execution and simulation of assembly language programs for the 8086 microprocessor. emu8086 provides a visual representation of registers and memory, making it easier to debug and understand low-level machine operations.

To run these programs on your machine, you'll need to download and install emu8086.

## How to Use

To explore the lab code pictures and practice materials, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Raihan4520/COA.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the appropriate folder (Mid Term, Final Term, or Practice Codes) to view the images of the assembly code.
3. To replicate the lab codes or practice them, install emu8086 and type the programs manually into the emulator or open practice codes in the emulator.
